# WebResume
The goal of the WebResume project is to create a website that shares with the visitor a 
little bit about myself, my skills, my past experiences, and feature projects that I have been
a part of. This project is also a means of learning more about angular/Web development.

If you have questions about the project feel free to contact me!
