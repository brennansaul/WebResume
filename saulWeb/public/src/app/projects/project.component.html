      <h3>WebResume</h3>
      <p>The website that you are browsing is a project of my own!
        This website is developed using angular 4. WebResume contains both custom and bootstrap
        elements. The goal of
        the WebResume project is to create a website that shares with the visitor
        a little bit about myself, my skills, my past experiences, and feature
        projects that I have been a part of. <p>

      <h3>Docker: World's Smartest Paperweight</h3>
      <p>Developed during my internship at <a href="https://www.flairdata.com/">
        Flair Data Systems</a>, the DWSP is a lab driven
        learning application for the Docker Engine that runs on a stack of Raspberry Pis.
        The application informs the user about what docker is and how to use
        several of its capabilities. The user learns about basic docker commands,
        building images, load balancing, and using docker swarm mode by walking
        through 3 interactive labs where the user can execute the commands
        provided by the step by step guide in the application using shellinabox
         terminal.<p>

      <h3>Push Stock</h3>
      <p>This <b>first place</b> winnning group project was developed as a Senior Capstone Project during
         our teams last semester at Baylor University. This project was provided to us by
          Pariveda Solutions. The goal of this project was to integrate all of
          the knowledge learned throughout college and apply it in a situation
          that resembled situations found in industry. We were given a fictional
           problem and we had 15 weeks to implement a solution for such a problem.
           The solution was an IOT involving a raspberry pi, BTLE Flic button,
           and a CentOS server. We used a MEAN stack which was comprised of: MONGO
           DB, ExpressJS, Angular2 (ionic for mobile application), and NodeJS<p>
